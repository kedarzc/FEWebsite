Greetings !

Thank you for reading. I hope you can take away something positive from this website in general.

My name is Kedar Malusare and I was born in a city called Baroda, India in the year 1988. I would say I belong to a generation that got the best of both worlds.
We grew up when cable television wasn't that popular back in India. The closest relative to a cellphone we had seen was a 'pager'. For the young ones, google it.
We did not have the internet. Heck even computers hadn't penetrated our lives. We got to enjoy the purer things in life that kids after us would never get a chance to experience.

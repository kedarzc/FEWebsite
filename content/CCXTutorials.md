title: Finite elements using CalculiX
---
## Description
Calculix is an excellent non-linear solver but lacks in a easy to use pre and post processor. I use [Mecway](https://mecway.com/) both as pre and post processor. Sometimes I use the natively shipped post processor cgx.

### Simple Simulation Examples

- [Static calculation of a linear spring]({{< ref "/ccxtuts/StaticLinSpring.md" >}})
- [Static calculation of a nonlinear spring]({{< ref "/ccxtuts/StaticNonLinSpring.md" >}})
- Frequency calculation of a spring-mass system
- Frequency calculation of a spring - plane strain element combination
- Modal dynamic calculation of a spring-mass system
- Spring between node and ground (Spring1 element)
- Spring between two nodes acting in a fixed direction (Spring2 element)
- [Circular plate under uniform load - CAX6 elements]({{< ref "/ccxtuts/CircularPlateCAX6.md" >}})

### Advanced Simulation Examples

- [Static displacement of a spring system]({{< ref "/ccxtuts/SpringProblem.md" >}})
- [Tensile test on a steel specimen]({{< ref "/ccxtuts/TensionTest.md" >}})

title: Practical Finite Elements

## General Observation
I have observed over my years at the University and later that most of the information out there available for engineering regarding finite elements is mostly theoretical. A practicing engineer thus is forced to learn through his/her own experience or from his peers. This information on this page tries to teach the more *practical* aspects of finite elements. I will skip the introduction because you can always pick up a textbook and read about it.

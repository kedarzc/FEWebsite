title: Practical Finite Elements

## General Observation
I have observed during my years at the University and later during working in the industry that most of the information out there available for engineers regarding finite elements is mostly theoretical. A practicing engineer thus is forced to learn through his/her own experience or from their peers. The information on this page tries to teach the more *practical* aspects of finite elements. I will skip the introduction because you can always pick up a textbook and read about it.

1. [Theory of finite elements]({{< ref "/practicalFiniteElements/prac_FE_derivingEquations.md" >}}) - Deriving the basic equations
2. Elements
3. Meshing
4. Loads
5. Boundary conditions
6. Solving and types of analyses
7. Post processing - Interpretation of results

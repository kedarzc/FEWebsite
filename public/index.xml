      <description>Description Calculix is an excellent non-linear solver but lacks in a easy to use pre and post processor. I use Mecway both as pre and post processor. Sometimes I use the natively shipped post processor cgx.
Simple Simulation Examples  Static calculation of a linear spring Static calculation of a nonlinear spring Frequency calculation of a spring-mass system Frequency calculation of a spring - plane strain element combination Modal dynamic calculation of a spring-mass system Spring between node and ground (Spring1 element) Spring between two nodes acting in a fixed direction (Spring2 element) Circular plate under uniform load - CAX6 elements  Advanced Simulation Examples  Static displacement of a spring system Tensile test on a steel specimen  </description>

      <description>General Observation I have observed over my years at the University and later that most of the information out there available for engineering regarding finite elements is mostly theoretical. A practicing engineer thus is forced to learn through his/her own experience or from his peers. This information on this page tries to teach the more practical aspects of finite elements. I will skip the introduction because you can always pick up a textbook and read about it.</description>
